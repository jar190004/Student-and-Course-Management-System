# Student-and-Course-Management-System
This Java program creates a Student Management System with a Course Management System.

In the student management system, the user is presented with a menu and should be able to add, delete, search, and display the complete list of students in order by the first name. They should also assign a job to students and display students that have a job.

In the course management system, the user is presented with a similar menu that should be able to add a course, assign a course to a student, and display students with assigned courses.

The Student and Course class holds the values of anything the user inputs.
